              We believe that the door to salvation is always open and so are
              the doors to our church. Our mission is to be fully devoted to
              Jesus by opening our arms to those in search of the truth. We show
              Godâ€™s love and concern for our fellow man at every opportunity.
              Through works of charity and opening our doors to listen and love,
              we feel that we are walking in the footsteps of Jesus Christ.
